		<h3>Git:</h3>
			<p>
				It is a distributed version control system for tracking the history of the files in minimum effort and space. It has also made collaboration more efficient and secured among any kind of knowledge workers than other alternatives. As with most other distributed version control systems and unlike most client server systems, every Git directory on every computer is full fledged repository with complete history and full version tracking abilities, independent of netwrok access or a central server. it servs as a complete history tracking, making create, edit, save and save again abilities convenient.
