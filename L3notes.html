			<p>Here are few reference topis for the assignment:</p>
	
		<h3>Client/ Server:</h3>

			<p>
				It is a type of netwrok architecture model where resources i.e applications, data etc. are distributed and shared over network. Usually servers are more resourceful and servs to clients that are any other or multiple connected computer system/s and device/s. Its the client who initiates the contacts for sharable resources.

		<h3>HTML Tags:</h3>
			
			<p>
				HTML tag is a set of characters that constitutes commands in a web page and provides the direction and specifications for the web browser that how it must format and display the content.

		<h3>Git:</h3>
			<p>
				It is a distributed version control system for tracking the history of the files in minimum effort and space. It has also made collaboration more efficient and secured among any kind of knowledge workers than other alternatives. As with most other distributed version control systems and unlike most client server systems, every Git directory on every computer is full fledged repository with complete history and full version tracking abilities, independent of netwrok access or a central server. it servs as a complete history tracking, making create, edit, save and save again abilities convenient.

		<h3 class="task">Task</h3>

		<h3>What is an HTML tag? Give three examples of tags</h3>

		<h3>What is an empty tag? How does it differ from a regular tag?</h3>
			<p>
				Empty Tag: Empty tags are void tags that are not required to be closed in the HTML document. Examples of empty tags are - "br" line breaks, "hr" horizontal line, "img" displaying image etc. On the other hand, regular tags differ from empty tags by having a proper end tag machine the start tag with a “/” in front and containing elements and values unlike empty tags that only contain attributes.

		<h3>How do you add an id to an HTML tag? Go ahead and add an ID element to one of your tags in notes.html</h3>
			<p>
				id is being added with an # mark followed by the name of the unique id element, to be used everytime this formatting is required. in this assignment, the Lab 2.2 HTML Knowledge heading has been formatted using id where dodger blue color is used and the texts are aligned in the center with 20px padding. as id is unique for an particular element, that is only the second part of the assigment heading has been re-formatted, keeping the first part as is to avoid id duplicasy. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_id.asp">click for source</a>
			</p>

		<h3 class="task">Task</h3>

		<h3>How do you add a class to an HTML tag? Add one or more classes to one of your tags in notes.html</h3>
			<p>
				A class is being added by placing a . (period) infornst of the clas sof the elements and then specifying the attributes of the element class or group of similar elemnts. Here in this assignment a class has been added for Task in the Practice part of the Lab assignment #2 as h2 to where the style has been formatted with background color as Tomato and text as white and padding of 3 px. . <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_classes.asp"></a>
			</p>

		<h3 class="task">Task</h3>

		<h3>Why wuld you use an ID vs a class?</h3>
			<p>
				Use a class when you want to consistently style multiple elements throughout the page/site. Classes are useful when you have, or possibly will have in the future, more than one element that shares the same style. An example may be a div of "comments" or a certain list style to use for related links.
				Additionally, a given element can have more than one class associated with it, while an element can only have one id. For example, you can give a div two classes whose styles will both take effect.
				Use the ID when you have a single element on the page that will take the style. Remember that IDs must be unique. In your case this may be the correct option, as there presumably will only be one "main" div on the page. Examples of ids are: main-content, header, footer, or left sidebar. A good way to remember this is a class is a type of item and the id is the unique name of an item on the page.

		<h3>What is a type selector?</h3>
			<p>
				It is a pattern of elements and other terms that tell the browser which HTML elements should be selected to have the CSS property values inside the rule applied to them. The element or elements which are selected by the selector are referred to as the subject of the selector.

		<h3>Body is the body tag is for? What are some tags that go inside it?</h3>
			<p>
				The body tag is used to contain a web page's content, including hyperlinks, images, tables, text, etc. It is required in every HTML document, and there may only be one body tag per page. The body element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as text, hyperlinks, images, tables, lists, etc. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_body.asp">click here for source</a>

			<p class="sansserif"> To calculate the width of the element, both left and right padding areas, border areas and margin areas are added to the content width of the element. On the other hand, to calculate the height, both top and bottom padding areas, border areas and margin areas are added to the hight of the content of the element. <strong>Problem solution: Element width is 418px and height is 265px. The content width is 400px and height is 250px.</strong>

    			C-3PO and R2-D2 are sent to Jabba's palace on Tatooine in a trade bargain made by Luke Skywalker to rescue Han Solo from crime lord Jabba the Hutt. Disguised as a bounty hunter, Princess Leia infiltrates the palace under the pretense of collecting the bounty on Chewbacca and unfreezes Han but is caught and enslaved. Luke soon arrives to bargain for his friends' release, but Jabba drops him through a trapdoor to be executed by a rancor. After Luke kills the rancor, Jabba sentences him, Han, and Chewbacca to death by being fed to the Sarlacc, a huge, carnivorous plant-like desert beast. Having hidden his new lightsaber inside R2-D2, Luke frees himself and battles Jabba's guards while Leia uses her chains to strangle Jabba to death. As the others rendezvous with the Rebel Alliance, Luke returns to Dagobah to complete his training with Yoda, whom he finds is dying. Yoda confirms that Darth Vader, once known as Anakin Skywalker, is Luke's father, and becomes one with the Force. The Force ghost of Obi-Wan Kenobi reveals that Leia is Luke's twin sister, and tells Luke that he must face Vader again to finish his training and defeat the Empire.</p>

    			<p>The Rebel Alliance learns that the Empire has been constructing a second Death Star under the supervision of the Emperor himself. As the station is protected by an energy shield, Han leads a strike team to destroy the shield generator on the forest moon of Endor; doing so would allow a squadron of starfighters to destroy the Death Star. Luke and Leia accompany the strike team to Endor in a stolen Imperial shuttle. Luke and his companions encounter a tribe of Ewoks and, after an initial conflict, gain their trust. Later, Luke tells Leia that she is his sister, Vader is their father, and that he must confront him. Surrendering to Imperial troops, he is brought before Vader, and tries to convince his father to reject the dark side of the Force, to no avail.

			<h2>The positioning attribute</h2>
	
			<p>
				Position property helps to indicate what kind of positioning method is used for any element. <br><strong>Relative positioning</strong> is a positioning method where element is placed to it's normal position and setting top, bottom, left and right properties of a relatively positinoed elemtnt will make it adjusted away from it's normal position.<br><strong>Absolute postioning</strong> is a positioning method where object is postionined at anything but to it's static position and positioned near to it's positioned ancestor. However, if there is no ancestor, the element will move along with page scrolling.<br><strong>The Fixed positioning</strong> method is when the element is positioned relative to the viewpoint and always stays in the same place even the page moves. Usually the Top, Right, Bottom, Left properties are used. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.asp">click for the source</a>
