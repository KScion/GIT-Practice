		<h3>Git:</h3>

				It is a distributed version control system for tracking the history of the files in minimum effort and space. It has also made collaboration more efficient and secured among any kind of knowledge workers than other alternatives. As with most other distributed version control systems and unlike most client server systems, every Git directory on every computer is full fledged repository with complete history and full version tracking abilities, independent of netwrok access or a central server. it servs as a complete history tracking, making create, edit, save and save again abilities convenient.

		<h3>Why wuld you use an ID vs a class?</h3>
			<p>
				Use a class when you want to consistently style multiple elements throughout the page/site. Classes are useful when you have, or possibly will have in the future, more than one element that shares the same style. An example may be a div of "comments" or a certain list style to use for related links.
				Additionally, a given element can have more than one class associated with it, while an element can only have one id. For example, you can give a div two classes whose styles will both take effect.
				Use the ID when you have a single element on the page that will take the style. Remember that IDs must be unique. In your case this may be the correct option, as there presumably will only be one "main" div on the page. Examples of ids are: main-content, header, footer, or left sidebar. A good way to remember this is a class is a type of item and the id is the unique name of an item on the page.
