<h4 style="color: powderblue">Why Blockchain:</h4>

	<ul style="color: white">
		<li>I have always been keen in Information Technology and now that I am starting over my career and life in general here in Canada, I am planning to merge my previous experience in Business with one of the Technologies that are expected to be widely deployed in coming decade/s.</li>
		<li>After doing some researches online, it was really easy to pick Blockchain technology as I believe it has huge potential to facilitate any and every organization across industries around the world.
